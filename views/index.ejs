            <p>You don't need an app to use Omegle on your phone or tablet! The web site
                works great on mobile.
            <p>
                Omeegle is a great way to meet new friends, even while practicing
                social distancing. When you use Omegle, you are paired randomly with another
                person to talk one-on-one. If you prefer, you can add your interests and you'll
                be randomly paired with someone who selected some of the same interests.

                To help you stay safe, chats are anonymous unless you tell someone who you
                are (not recommended!), and you can stop a chat at any time. See our Terms of
                Service and Community Guidelines for more info about the do's and don'ts in
                using Omegle. Omegle video chat is moderated but no moderation is perfect.
                Users are solely responsible for their behavior while using Omegle.
            </p>
            YOU MUST BE 18 OR OLDER TO USE OMEGLE. See Omegle's Terms of
            Service for more info. Parental control protections that may assist parents are
            commercially available and you can find more info at
            https://www.connectsafely.org/controls/ as well as other sites.
            </p>
            Please leave Omeegle and visit an adult site instead if that's what you're looking
            for, and you are 18 or older.
